An example that shows how digestive functors can work together with the
Snap.Snaplet.Auth library.

This does not quite work yet, but the goal is to make it work. :)

There are still some things to improve:
  - the little library Util/Form.hs is not a standalone library, but depends
    on the Application, there might be a better place for the showForm
    function
  - the authentication backend "users.json" is hardcoded in two different
    locations, this breaks the DRY principle
